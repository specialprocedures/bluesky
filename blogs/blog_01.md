There are several nice things about Bluesky from an analyst's perspective:

## The API
The API is completely open, free to use, and despite a few eccentricities, pretty straightforward. This means that unlike other platforms (e.g., X, Facebook, LinkedIn) we can access as much data as we like without having to use any workarounds.

## Starter Packs and Lists
When doing social media analysis, having a starting point helps things incredibly. Lists and Starter Packs are available for a wide range of themes, from politicians, to journalists, climate voices, or trolls.

Many different users have taken the time to collect "Starter Packs" of UK Labour MPs and Councillors, we can user their lists to kick-start our analysis.
